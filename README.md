## :scroll: About

1. This repository contains an easy-to-use restful api that aims to help a user identify the similarity among the texts.
2. The user registers in the application and passes the texts that are needed to be checked.
3. The application calculates the similarity ratio and returns the ratio to the user. This ratio returned is between 0 and 1.
4. The closer the ratio is to 1, the more the similarity index in the first and second texts.

## :dart: Features

<ul type="square">
 <li>Follows RESTful API Design</li>
 <li>Supports JSON Requests and Responses</li>
 <li>Has Hash Enabled Credentials Storage Mechanism</li>
 <li>Application Dependencies and Database Installations Configured in Docker Image</li>
 <li>Faster Api Deployment Using Docker Container</li>
